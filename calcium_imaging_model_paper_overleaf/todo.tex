Figure 3.
- put all traces above each other in rows.
- make all lines thicker
- expand panel A
- add a panel B which shows the destiny of newly influxed calcium over time.

Figure 4.
- add panel A showing schematic diagram of what you did. I am thinking, original data -> fit model -> simulate trace then three arrows branching out to the spike inference three algorithms (from both data and simulated trace), then something to indicate the true positive calculations.
