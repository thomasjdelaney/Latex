# Applications for postdoctoral positions

This part of the Latex repo is for containing my applications for postdoctoral positions. This particular document is for keeping of general guidlines and notes. That is, things that are useful to remember when making applications.

## Format of applications

The applications tend to consist of four separate parts.

- a cover letter
- a CV
- a publication list
- contact information for references

---

### Cover letters

The cover letter should achieve the following objectives:

- Get the attention of the employer.
- Demonstrate that you have done some research on the role, and the institution.
- Explain why you are suitable for the role.
- Set you apart from other applicants.
- Demonstrate your ability to communicate effectively in written English.

You should send a cover letter unless you are asked not to do so. The cover letter will probably be read by non-academic staff, so it not suitable to go into depth about research. It is best to keep the letter succint. Aim for less than one A4 page of size 11 font text. Use the paragraph format unless using bullet points or numbering would be very useful.

The paragraphs might consist of the following:

Salutations
: Make sure the salutation is to a particular person, like the head of the department or whatever.

First paragraph
: For which post are you applying? How did you hear about it? Your academic background and research interests. Mention that you are doing a PhD, the title/subject, and the supervisor.

Middle section
: Research interests and achievements, teaching and administrative activities. Mention future research plans. Try to point out how these experiences have prepared you for this particular post. 

Final section
: Explain why you are attracted to this role, and how it will fit into your career plans.

Conclusion
: Mention the other enclosed documents. Summarise why you are suitable, and express an interest in an interview.

#### Tailoring the letter

The cover letter should be tailored to each individual post. The best way to do this is to do research on the post, the institution, the department, the principal investigator etc. This can be achieved through

- online research
- calling the department on the phone
- contacting other academics in the department.

#### Marketing yourself

Before writing the letter, you should have an idea of what your unique strengths are for this application. To decide what these strengths are, you should consider what will separate you from the competition. You may have great strength in the specific research area. You may have unique experiences like a blend of academic and professional experience. 

#### "Do"s and "Don't"s

Do

- Put your most convincing evidence/arguments first. 
- Illustrate your achievements with brief and specific examples. Refer to the CV if necessary.
- Concentrate on areas that differentiate you from the competition, rather than the basic requirements.
- Be succint. No verbose sentences.

Don't

- Try to summarise your CV. You're sending that too anyway.
- Make claims about skills and experiences without giving examples.
- Use jargon that the employer may not understand.
- Focus on what the employer can do for you, but what you can do for the employer.

---

### Curriculum Vitae

The Curriculum Vitae, or 'CV'.

#### Formatting

- Put the most relevant or important information first. What is most relevant will depend on the post for which you are applying.
- Pay attention to section titles. Could they sound more impressive?
- Use active verbs and fragmented sentences. Try to avoid using pronouns. 
- Look for some example CV from someone.

### List of publications

I don't have any publications at the moment. In any applications I make, I should explain that it is not unusual for students doing their PhD in the UK to come to the end of their degree without publications.

---

### Contact information for references

- One of the academic referees should be the supervisor.
- Should email the Japanese post about their request for a reference from a 'previous employer'.
