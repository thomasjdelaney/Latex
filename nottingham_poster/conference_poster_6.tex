\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Introduction}\color{Black}}

Information in the brain is carried in correlated network activity. Until recently, it has been difficult to record responses from multiple brain regions simultaneously. This meant that studies on network behaviour were restricted to studying only one region at a time. The development of `Neuropixels' probes have allowed extracellular voltage measurements to be collected from multiple brain regions simultaneously. In this project, we used data collected from five different brain regions to compare distributions of correlated activity within these regions, and between these regions.

We then used these measurements to create networks between the neurons in these five regions. We used a cutting edge community detection algorithm to find communities in these networks. We are currently in the process of comparing these communities to the anatomical distribution of their constituents.

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Main Objectives}\color{NavyBlue}}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item To compare the distributions of spike count correlations ($r_{SC}$) and mutual information ($I(X;Y)$) in different regions.
  \item To examine the relationship between these measurements and firing rates across all regions.
  \item To detect any communities in the networks created by these measurements, either within or between the anatomical regions.
  \item To compare the network communities to their anatomical distribution.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Data}\color{NavyBlue}}

Using two probes, spiking activity was simultaneously collected from over 800 neurons in an awake mouse brain for a period of 84 minutes. During this period, the mouse and was shown various visual stimuli. The 800 neurons were distributed across 5 different brain regions: \textbf{V1, hippocampus, thalamus, motor cortex}, and \textbf{striatum} \cite{jun}.

%	MATERIALS AND METHODS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Materials and Methods}\color{Black}}

\begin{description}
  \item[Spike Count Correlation, $r_{SC}$] We measured Pearson's correlation between the spike counts of neurons in pairs.
  \item[Mutual Information, $I(X;Y)$] We measured the mutual information between the spike counts of neurons in pairs.
  \item[Network Noise Rejection] We used a recently developed method to split the networks created by these measures into signal and noise networks \cite{humphries}.
  \item[Consensus Clustering] We used consensus clustering on the signal network to investigate any communities within these networks \cite{humphries}.

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Results}\color{Black}}

\subsection*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Correlation \& Information Distributions}\color{Black}}

We used a statistical test to find out if the distributions of pairwise correlations were different between regions. We found that correlations in the hippocampus and thalamus were statistically different to those in the other three regions ($p < 0.05$).

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=7.5cm]{correlation_histograms.png}
\captionof{figure}{Histograms of the spike count correlations of 1000 randomly chosen pairs of neurons from within each region.}

We did the same for mutual information distributions. Comparing all pairwise combinations of regions, we found that all regional distributions of mutual information were statistically different ($p < 0.001$).

\subsection*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Pairwise Geomtric Mean, Correlation \& Information}\color{Black}}

We compared the spike count correlations for pairs of neurons to the geometric means of their firing rates. Surprisingly, we found very little correlation between the two quantities.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=7.5cm]{correlation_vs_geometric_mean.png}
\captionof{figure}{Spike count correlations of pairs of neurons plotted against geometric means of the firing rate of those pairs for each region.}

We found a strong positive correlation between the pairwise geometric mean and the mutual information.

\includegraphics[width=\linewidth, height=7.5cm]{info_vs_geometric_mean.png}
\captionof{figure}{Mutual information of pairs of neurons plotted against geometric means of the firing rate of those pairs for each region.}

We expected strong spike count correlations to correspond to relatively large values for the mutual information. So we scattered one quantity against the other and fitted a quadratic curve to the data. Whatever correlation we found between the two quantities was not as strong as we expected.

\subsection*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Community Detection}\color{Black}}

Using Network Noise Rejection and Consensus Clustering, we detected two communities in the network created by the mutual information measurements. It appears that one community is dominated by the thalamus, and the other community is dominated by the motor cortex and striatum.

%	CONCLUSIONS
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Conclusions}\color{Black}}

\begin{itemize}
  \item The pairwise measurements we took were distributed differently in different brain regions.
  \item The mutual information between two cells is strongly correlated with the geometric mean of their firing rates.
  \item Functional communities exist across anatomical regions.
  \item The thalamus appears to be more isolated functionally than the other anatomical regions.
\end{itemize}

%	FORTHCOMING RESEARCH
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\section*{\color{NavyBlue}\textsc{Forthcoming Research}\color{Black}}

Different pairwise measurements could be used along with the community detection. Alternatively, higher order correlation measures, such as population coupling could be examined. Changes in community structure in response to different stimuli could be examined.
