  \opening{\textbf{Dear Ms. Thorne,}}

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  I am writing to you to apply for a suitable position in Marshall Wace LLP, most likely in quantitative research, quantitative trading or something related.

  I worked in the Marshall Wace London and Hong Kong offices before in 2013/2014, as a kdb+ engineer. I enjoyed the working atmosphere, and I was interested in the work done by the QR and QT teams but I was not qualified enough for that work at that time.

  In the meantime, I have done an MSc in Informatics and I have worked as a data engineer in Edinburgh airport. I have completed a PhD in Computer Science. I have presented my research at number of international conferences. I have done an internship in CheckRisk, a risk analysis company. I have also worked as a teaching assistant and an exam supervisor. Lastly, I have developed and matured personally.

  During the MSc and PhD, I learned and implemented the skills that I was lacking in 2014. So I am a good candidate for Marshall Wace now. Thank you for your consideration. I'll look forward to your response.
