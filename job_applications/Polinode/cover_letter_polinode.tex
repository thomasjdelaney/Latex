  \opening{\textbf{Dear Sir/Madame,}}

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRODUCTION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  I am writing to you to apply for a position on the `AI for Life' Residency Program in Novartis's Dublin offices as advertised on the indeed.com. I have uploaded my CV to your application process for consideration.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Why am I suitable? %%%%%%%%%%%%%
  I recently finished my PhD in Computer Science specialising in computational neuroscience in the Universtiy of Bristol. During my PhD I presented my work at several international conferences.  I also have a publication in process, in collaboration with my supervisor Dr. Cian O'Donnell.

  I have more than three years of previous professional experience as a software engineer and as a data engineer. I worked as a consultant in large international companies, but I worked in small teams. So I have the interpersonal skills to work in a team as part of a larger project.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%% What can I do for the company? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  If I am chosen for this position, Novartis will not only gain a resident on their `AI for Life' program, they will also gain a dedicated employee with experience and potential ready to start a long and prosperous career.

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%% Reiterate suitability %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  I am confident that I am an ideal candidate for this role. I have the required technical expertise to add value in Novartis. I also have the enthusiasm to make the most of the opportunity. I would be an excellent choice for Novartis in this case.

  Looking forward to hearing back from you.
