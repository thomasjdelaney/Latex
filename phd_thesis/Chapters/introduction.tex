\section{Introduction}
Ideas (not in order):
\begin{itemize}
    \item From small for big datasets (in terms of number of neurons)
    \item Big datasets mean statistical methods are more necessary (curse of dimensionality)
    \item Big datasets mean higher order correlations are more meaningful (schneidman)
    \item Exploit pairwise correlations in different way (eight probe)
    \item abandon correlations embrace association (COMB)
    \item electrophysiology drawbacks vs calcium benefits
    \item calcium drawbacks (fluorescence modelling)
\end{itemize}
