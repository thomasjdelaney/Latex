\section{Discussion}
Ideas (not in order):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Calcium imaging limitations (spike inference not always possible)
  \item Judging by Greenberg biophysical modelling is the way to go.
  \item our fluorescence model could be useful in a number of situations.
  \item Applied new network science to new electrophysiological dataset.
  \item Abandon calcium
  \item Multi region calcium imaging dataset would be useful?
  \item Results might be intuitive, but are new nonetheless (as far as I know)
  \item Potential for more network science applications?
  \item Applied the COMB distribution to neuronal data for the first time.
  \item captures correlated behaviour by quantifying \textit{association}.
  \item Abandon correlations.
  \item coupling with existing models could yield some nice models.
  \item More statistical invention could be useful.
\end{itemize}
