    abstract = {Author summary Two-photon calcium imaging is one of the major tools to study the activity of large populations of neurons in the brain. In this technique, a fluorescent calcium indicator changes its brightness when a neuron fires an action potential due to an associated increase in intracellular calcium. However, while a number of algorithms have been proposed for estimating spike rates from the measured signal, the problem is far from solved. We organized a public competition using a data set for which ground truth data was available. Participants were given a training set to develop new algorithms, and the performance of the algorithms was evaluated on a hidden test set. Here we report on the results of this competition and discuss the progress made towards better algorithms to infer spiking activity from imaging data.},

	abstract = {Two-photon calcium imaging is a powerful means for monitoring the activity of distinct neurons in brain tissue in vivo. In the mammalian brain, such imaging studies have been restricted largely to calcium recordings from neurons that were individually dye-loaded through microelectrodes. Previous attempts to use membrane-permeant forms of fluorometric calcium indicators to load populations of neurons have yielded satisfactory results only in cell cultures or in slices of immature brain tissue. Here we introduce a versatile approach for loading membrane-permeant fluorescent indicator dyes in large populations of cells. We established a pressure ejection-based local dye delivery protocol that can be used for a large spectrum of membrane-permeant indicator dyes, including calcium green-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester, Fura-2 AM, Fluo-4 AM, and Indo-1 AM. We applied this dye-loading protocol successfully in mouse brain tissue at any developmental stage from newborn to adult in vivo and in vitro. In vivo two-photon Ca2+ recordings, obtained by imaging through the intact skull, indicated that whisker deflection-evoked Ca2+ transients occur in a subset of layer 2/3 neurons of the barrel cortex. Thus, our results demonstrate the suitability of this technique for real-time analyses of intact neuronal circuits with the resolution of individual cells.},

    abstract = {Abstract Calcium imaging of individual neurons is widely used for monitoring their activity in vitro and in vivo. Synthetic fluorescent calcium indicator dyes are commonly used, but the resulting calcium signals sometimes suffer from a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, it is difficult to detect signals caused by single action potentials (APs) particularly from neurons in vivo. Here we showed that a recently developed calcium indicator dye, Cal-520, is sufficiently sensitive to reliably detect single APs both in vitro and in vivo. In neocortical neurons, calcium signals were linearly correlated with the number of APs, and the SNR was > 6 for in vitro slice preparations and > 1.6 for in vivo anesthetised mice. In cerebellar Purkinje cells, dendritic calcium transients evoked by climbing fiber inputs were clearly observed in anesthetised mice with a high SNR and fast decay time. These characteristics of Cal-520 are a great advantage over those of Oregon Green BAPTA-1, the most commonly used calcium indicator dye, for monitoring the activity of individual neurons both in vitro and in vivo.},

    ABSTRACT={We have built a stochastic model in the program MCell that simulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in spines from the principal molecular components believed to control Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and exit. Proteins, with their kinetic models, are located within two segments of dendrites containing 88 intact spines, centered in a fully reconstructed 6 × 6 × 5 μm<sup>3</sup> cube of hippocampal neuropil. Protein components include AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, L- and R-type voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers, plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, smooth endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPases, immobile Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers, and calbindin. Kinetic models for each protein were taken from published studies of the isolated proteins in vitro. For simulation of electrical stimuli, the time course of voltage changes in the dendritic spine was generated with the desired stimulus in the program NEURON. Voltage-dependent parameters were then continuously re-adjusted during simulations in MCell to reproduce the effects of the stimulus. Nine parameters of the model were optimized within realistic experimental limits by a process that compared results of simulations to published data. We find that simulations in the optimized model reproduce the timing and amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients measured experimentally in intact neurons. Thus, we demonstrate that the characteristics of individual isolated proteins determined in vitro can accurately reproduce the dynamics of experimentally measured Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in spines. The model will provide a test bed for exploring the roles of additional proteins that regulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into spines and for studying the behavior of protein targets in the spine that are regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.}

We developed a single-wavelength GCaMP2-based GECI (GCaMP3), with increased baseline fluorescence (3-fold), increased dynamic range (3-fold) and higher affinity for calcium (1.3-fold). We detected GCaMP3 fluorescence changes triggered by single action potentials in pyramidal cell dendrites, with signal-to-noise ratio and photostability substantially better than those of GCaMP2, D3cpVenus and TN-XXL. In Caenorhabditis elegans chemosensory neurons and the Drosophila melanogaster antennal lobe, sensory stimulation-evoked fluorescence responses were significantly enhanced with GCaMP3 (4-6-fold). In somatosensory and motor cortical neurons in the intact mouse, GCaMP3 detected calcium transients with amplitudes linearly dependent on action potential number. Long-term imaging in the motor cortex of behaving mice revealed large fluorescence changes in imaged neurons over months.},

    abstract={1. Digital imaging and photometry were used in conjunction with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, Fura-2, to examine intracellular Ca2+ signals produced by depolarization of single adrenal chromaffin cells. 2. Depolarization with a patch pipette produced radial gradients of Ca2+ within the cell, with Ca2+ concentration highest in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. These gradients dissipated within a few hundred milliseconds when the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were closed. 3. Dialysis of Fura-2 into the chromaffin cell caused concentration-dependent changes in the depolarization-induced Ca2+ signal, decreasing its magnitude and slowing its recovery time course. These changes were used to estimate the properties of the endogenous cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffer with which Fura-2 competes for Ca2+. 4. The spatially averaged Fura-2 signal was well described by a model assuming fast competition between Fura-2 and an endogenous buffer on a millisecond time scale. Retrieval of calcium by pumps and slow buffers occurs on a seconds-long time scale. No temporal changes indicative of buffers with intermediate kinetics could be detected. 5. Two independent estimates of the capacity of the fast endogenous Ca2+ buffer suggest that 98-99{\%} of the Ca2+ entering the cell normally is taken up by this buffer. This buffer appears to be immobile, because it does not wash out of the cell during dialysis. It has a low affinity for Ca2+ ions, because it does not saturate with 1 microM-Ca2+ inside the cell. 6. The low capacity, affinity and mobility of the endogenous Ca2+ buffer makes it possible for relatively small amounts of exogenous Ca2+ buffers, such as Fura-2, to exert a significant influence on the characteristics of the Ca2+ concentration signal as measured by fluorescence ratios. On the other hand, even at moderate Fura-2 concentrations (0.4 mM) Fura-2 will dominate over the endogenous buffers. Under these conditions radiometric Ca2+ concentration signals are largely attenuated, but absolute fluorescence changes (at 390 nm) accurately reflect calcium fluxes.},

The ability of Purkinje cells to rapidly buffer depolarization-evoked intracellular calcium changes (delta [Ca2+]i) was estimated by titrating the endogenous buffer against incremental concentrations of the Ca(2+)-sensitive dye fura-2. 2. In cells from 15-day-old rats, pulse-evoked delta [Ca2+]i were stable during the loading with 0.5 mM fura-2 through the patch pipette. In cells from 6-day-old rats, delta [Ca2+]i decreased by approximately 50\% during equivalent experiments. This decrease was not related to changes in Ca2+ influx, since the integral of the Ca2+ currents remained constant throughout the recording. 3. Experiments with high fura-2 concentrations (1.75-3.5 mM) were performed in order to obtain for each cell the curve relating delta [Ca2+]i to fura-2 concentration. From this relationship, values for the Ca2+ binding ratio (the ratio of buffer-bound Ca2+ changes over free Ca2+ changes) were calculated. 4. In Purkinje cells from 15-day-old rats, the Ca2+ binding ratio was approximately 2000, an order of magnitude larger than that of other neurones and neuroendocrine cells studied to date. This Ca2+ binding ratio was significantly smaller (approximately 900) in Purkinje cells from 6-day-old rats. 5. We propose that the large Ca2+ binding ratio of Purkinje cells is related to the presence of large concentrations of Ca2+ binding proteins and that these cells regulate their ability to handle Ca2+ loads during development through changes in the concentration of Ca2+ binding proteins.},

    abstract={Visual attention can improve behavioral performance by allowing observers to focus on the important information in a complex scene. Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80{\%} of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

Here we demonstrate that the relative timing of cortical action potentials can signal stimulus features themselves, a function even more basic than feature grouping. Populations of neurons in the primary auditory cortex can coordinate the relative timing of their action potentials such that spikes occur closer together in time during continuous stimuli. In this way cortical neurons can signal stimuli even when their firing rates do not change. Population coding based on relative spike timing can systematically signal stimulus features, it is topographically mapped, and it follows the stimulus time course even where mean firing rate does not.},

	abstract = {How is it that groups of neurons dispersed through the brain interact to generate complex behaviors? Three papers in this issue present brain-scale studies of neuronal activity and dynamics (see the Perspective by Huk and Hart). Allen et al. found that in thirsty mice, there is widespread neural activity related to stimuli that elicit licking and drinking. Individual neurons encoded task-specific responses, but every brain area contained neurons with different types of response. Optogenetic stimulation of thirst-sensing neurons in one area of the brain reinstated drinking and neuronal activity across the brain that previously signaled thirst. Gr{\"u}ndemann et al. investigated the activity of mouse basal amygdala neurons in relation to behavior during different tasks. Two ensembles of neurons showed orthogonal activity during exploratory and nonexploratory behaviors, possibly reflecting different levels of anxiety experienced in these areas. Stringer et al. analyzed spontaneous neuronal firing, finding that neurons in the primary visual cortex encoded both visual information and motor activity related to facial movements. The variability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli in the primary visual area is mainly related to arousal and reflects the encoding of latent behavioral states.Science, this issue p. eaav3932, p. eaav8736, p. eaav7893; see also p. 236INTRODUCTIONIn the absence of sensory inputs, the brain produces structured patterns of activity, which can be as large as or larger than sensory-driven activity. Ongoing activity exists even in primary sensory cortices and has been hypothesized to reflect recapitulation of previous sensory experiences, or expectations of possible sensory events. Alternatively, ongoing activity could be related to behavioral and cognitive states.RATIONALEMuch previous work has linked spontaneous neural activity to behavior through one-dimensional measures like running speed and pupil diameter. However, mice perform diverse behaviors consisting of whisking, licking, sniffing, and other facial movements. We hypothesized that there exists a multidimensional representation of behavior in visual cortex and that previously reported {\textquotedblleft}noise{\textquotedblright} during stimulus presentations may in fact be behaviorally driven. To investigate this, we recorded the activity of ~10,000 neurons in visual cortex of awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging, while simultaneously monitoring the facial movements using an infrared camera. In a second set of experiments, we recorded the activity of thousands of neurons across the brain using eight simultaneous Neuropixels probes, again videographically monitoring facial behavior.RESULTSFirst, we found that ongoing activity in visual cortex is high dimensional: More than a hundred latent dimensions could be reliably extracted from the population activity. We found that a third of this activity could be predicted by a multidimensional model of the mouse{\textquoteright}s behavior, extracted from the face video. This behaviorally related activity was not limited to visual cortex. We observed multidimensional representations of behavior in electrophysiological recordings from frontal, sensorimotor, and retrosplenial cortex; hippocampus; striatum; thalamus; and midbrain. Even though both behavior and neural activity contained fast{\textendash}time scale fluctuations on the order of 200 ms, they were only related to each other at a time scale of about 1 s. We next investigated how this spontaneous, behavior-related signal interacts with stimulus responses. The representation of sensory stimuli and behavioral variables was mixed in the same neurons: The fractions of each neuron{\textquoteright}s variance explained by stimuli and by behavior were only slightly negatively correlated, and neurons with similar stimulus responses did not have more similar behavioral correlates. Nevertheless, at a population level, the neural dimensions encoding motor variables overlapped with those encoding visual stimuli along only one dimension, which coherently increased or decreased the activity of the entire population. Activity in all other behaviorally driven dimensions continued unperturbed regardless of sensory stimulation.CONCLUSIONThe brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation. We found that these multidimensional signals are present both during ongoing activity and during passive viewing of a stimulus. This suggests that previously reported noise during stimulus presentations may consist primarily of behavioral-state information. What benefit could this ubiquitous mixing of sensory and motor information provide? The most appropriate behavior for an animal to perform at any moment depends on the combination of available sensory data, ongoing motor actions, and purely internal variables such as motivational drives. Integration of sensory inputs with motor actions must therefore occur somewhere in the nervous system. Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex.Large-scale neural population recordings can be predicted from behavior.We used new recording technologies to simultaneously monitor the activity of ~10,000 neurons in a single brain area and ~3000 neurons from across the brain (top left). These neurons showed slow{\textendash}time scale patterns of coactivation restricted to subsets of neurons which were distributed across the brain (top right). The patterns of neural activity appeared to be driven by specific spontaneous behaviors that the animals engaged in during the experiment. We tracked these spontaneous behaviors by projecting a video recording of the mouse face onto a set of canonical {\textquotedblleft}eigenfaces{\textquotedblright} (bottom left) and used these projections to predict a large fraction of the neural activity (bottom right). t, time; PC, principal component.Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse{\textquoteright}s ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information.},

We calculate here the average of the bias, under certain conditions, as an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the size of the data sample. The result agrees with numerical simulations, and is applicable, as an additive correction term, to measurements obtained under such conditions. Moreover, we discuss the implications for measurements obtained through other usual procedures. }

For single neurons, similar spike patterns evoked by stimuli are evidence of common coding. Across multiple neurons, similar spike trains indicate potential cell assemblies. As recording technology advances, so does the urgent need for grouping methods to make sense of large-scale datasets of spike trains. Existing methods require specifying the number of groups in advance, limiting their use in exploratory analyses. I derive a new method from network theory that solves this key difficulty: it self-determines the maximum number of groups in any set of spike trains, and groups them to maximize intragroup similarity. This method brings us revealing new insights into the encoding of aversive stimuli by dopaminergic neurons, and the organization of spontaneous neural activity in cortex. I show that the characteristic pause response of a rat{\textquoteright}s dopaminergic neuron depends on the state of the superior colliculus: when it is inactive, aversive stimuli invoke a single pattern of dopaminergic neuron spiking; when active, multiple patterns occur, yet the spike timing in each is reliable. In spontaneous multineuron activity from the cortex of anesthetized cat, I show the existence of neural ensembles that evolve in membership and characteristic timescale of organization during global slow oscillations. I validate these findings by showing that the method both is remarkably reliable at detecting known groups and can detect large-scale organization of dynamics in a model of the striatum.},

    abstract = "This paper proposes an information theoretic criterion for comparing two partitions, or clusterings, of the same data set. The criterion, called variation of information (VI), measures the amount of information lost and gained in changing from clustering C to clustering C′. The basic properties of VI are presented and discussed. We focus on two kinds of properties: (1) those that help one build intuition about the new criterion (in particular, it is shown the VI is a true metric on the space of clusterings), and (2) those that pertain to the comparability of VI values over different experimental conditions. As the latter properties have rarely been discussed explicitly before, other existing comparison criteria are also examined in their light. Finally we present the VI from an axiomatic point of view, showing that it is the only “sensible” criterion for comparing partitions that is both aligned to the lattice and convexely additive. As a consequence, we prove an impossibility result for comparing partitions: there is no criterion for comparing partitions that simultaneously satisfies the above two desirable properties and is bounded."
