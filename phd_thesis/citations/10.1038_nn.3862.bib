    abstract={Primate cortex can be organized with specialization and hierarchical principles, but presently there is little evidence for how it is organized temporally. Across six separate datasets, the authors find a hierarchical ordering of intrinsic fluctuation of spiking activity, with timescales that increase from sensory to prefrontal areas.},
